# Frontend Mentor - Blog preview card

This is my Project for a Blog Preview Card for the Front end mentor site

## My goal is to make it as close to the below picture as possible

### A live site will be added when available

## Where to find everything

We also include variable and static font files for the required fonts for this project. You can choose to either link to Google Fonts or use the local font files to host the fonts yourself. Note that we've removed the static font files for the font weights that aren't needed for this project.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
